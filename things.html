			Hello there.  You've come to my website all about me.  Well technically it isn't ALL about me.  But whatever the case, you are here.  What's up with that?
		</p>
		<p>
			What can I really say about me and my wife?  We are photographers whose desire for God,  life and love has blossomed into a passion for capturing beauty one frame at a time.  We are wedding photographers that seek to find the romance of a couple from the excitement of an engagement to the joyfilled ceremony of unity.  Our style is in the beauty of natural light and the wonders of the outdoors.
